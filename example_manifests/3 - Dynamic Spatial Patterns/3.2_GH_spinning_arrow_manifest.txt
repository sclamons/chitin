# Classic synchronous GH excitable media emulated by a
# spinning-arrow surface CRN.
#
# Three initial states are provided:
#
# 1) spiral_init: The initial start state represents a single A in a field of Q,
# but with initial arrows and states appropriate to avoid deadlock.
#
# 2) pulse_init: The initial start state represents a truncated line of A/R in a field of Q,
# but with initial arrows and states appropriate to avoid deadlock.
#
# 3) random_init: The initial start state represents a random field of Q, A, R,
# but with initial arrows and states appropriate to avoid deadlock.
#
# Please be patient; this simulation can take a few minutes to initialize.
